<p><strong>Why study excitatory synaptic transmission?</strong> The synapse is a site of contact between two neurons. Excitatory chemical synapses are essential for information flow through neuronal circuits and a major site for the processing and storage of memories in the brain. Therefore, it is not surprising that synapses serve as the site of action for many prescribed medications and their disruption contributes to many neurological and psychiatric disorders. These include epilepsy, stroke, schizophrenia, autism, depression, addiction, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and traumatic brain injury. Hence, a fundamental understanding of the function, and plasticity of synapses is essential to advancing our knowledge about brain function in health and disease.</p>
<p><strong>Why brain slices?</strong> In our experiments, we record from brain tissue <em>ex vivo</em> brain tissue, meaning outside of the living body. This is achieved by cutting slices of the brain and either recording from them the same day (acute slices) or placing them in an incubator to culture over a couple of weeks before recording (organotypic slices). Brain slices maintain many aspects of <em>in vivo</em> biology, including functional local synaptic circuitry with preserved architecture. However, brain slices enable good experimental access compared to <em>in vivo</em> as well as precise control of the extracellular environment, for example using drugs, to help identify or isolate the molecular components underling measurements. In addition, voltage clamp recordings are more feasible in brain slices since it is easier to obtain good quality patch clamp recordings when patching under visual guidance (using a microscope). With organotypic slices, transfection or viral transduction can be accomplished relatively easily <em>in vitro</em> to study the function of novel genes or genetic manipulations. They are also amenable to longitudinal studies (i.e.¬†repeated measurements of the same variable over time) without ethical concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Why patch clamp technique?</strong> Currents elicited by unitary synaptic connections at CNS synapses are typically very small, so for precise and controlled detection of synaptic events one is best employing intracellular recording techniques. Application of patch-clamp techniques to brain slices has significantly advanced research on endogenous ion channels and the properties of synaptic transmission in central neurons. This recording technique has allowed direct observation of spontaneous and evoked synaptic currents as well as the gating of endogenous ion channels at single-channel resolution. It can also be used to dialyze neurons with compounds that can highlight the morphology of cells, thus extending the capabilities of patch clamp to assisting in anatomical studies. Together, these advances have contributed to our understanding of passive and active biophysical properties of excitable cells. A major advantage of this technique is that it provides information in real-time on how specific manipulations (e.g., pharmacological, experimenter-induced plasticity) may alter specific changes in neuronal or ion channel function.</p>

<h2>3. Detecting mEPSCs</h2>
<p>In the section we will be analysing some of the data like the ones we generated during the experiment seen in the previous topic. Synaptic events are particularly small, and some of them can be hard to distinguish from background noise. There is lots of software available to detect spontaneous synaptic currents. We use an open-source software designed to use time course information about the events of interest to help identify events occur, extract those parts of the recording and align the putative events. This software, developed by our lab at Sussex, is called Eventer (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/eventer/" class="uri">https://sourceforge.net/projects/eventer/</a>) and it facilitates speedy and reproducible analysis of spontaneous synaptic currents.</p>

<h3>Settings we need to check before loading the data</h3>
<p>Before selecting the data file we want to load, we need to set:</p>
<ul>
<li>which recording channel we want to load, and</li>
<li>whether we want to split the recordings into smaller waves settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only some data formats allow for multiple recording channels; the recordings you will analyse only have 1 channel so the <code>Channel</code> setting can be left at the default value of 1. Split can be used if you want to split a continuous recording wave into smaller waves for parallel processing or to synchronous artifacts (e.g.¬†current transients resulting from test pulses). The recording you will analyse is 2 minutes long with test pulses delivered every 30 seconds. Therefore, the first thing to do is set the <code>Split</code> value to 30 seconds. This will separate the 2 minute recording into 4 waves that are 30 seconds long each.</p>

<div id="section-excluding-regions-from-your-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Excluding regions from your analysis</h3>
<p>It is possible that there are regions of your data that you want to be excluded from the analysis. For example, this could be a particularly noisy section of recording or the inclusion of a test pulse as shown here. The synaptic events we recorded are all excitatory, so by convention downwards at this holding potential, however the current transients resulting from the test pulse are still visible and very large. These should be apparent near the start of the wave - we will exclude these artifacts from the analysis. To exclude these regions, open the <code>Exclude</code> tab and either:</p>
<ul>
<li>manually type in the start and end time of the exclusion zone around the test pulse, or<br />
</li>
<li>click the button decorated with a cursor pointer and click twice on the pop-up graph (Figure 7), before and after the artifact</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the artifact occurs at the same time in all waves, click the button <code>Apply to all waves</code>.</p>
<p>Look through the four waves again - are there any any periods of the recording where the baseline is unstable or the recording noise transiently becomes larger, which you might want to exclude. (Note that you probably won‚Äôt want to apply those additional exclusion zones at the same time in all the waves!)</p>

Eventer enables the user to filter their data through high- and low-pass filter cut offs. In the figure below, a 1 kHz <strong>low-pass</strong> filter has been set. To apply a 1 kHz low pass filter to your data, click the <code>Detection</code> tab, tick the appropriate <code>On/Off</code> checkbox and type 1000 Hz into the field labeled <code>Low-pass Filter Cut-Off</code>.</p>

<div id="section-defining-your-event-template" class="section level3">
<h3>Defining your event template</h3>
<p>We now must define a model template EPSC waveform that Eventer will use to detect the spontaneous mEPSCs by deconvolution. The deconvolutioon method used is based on [Pern√≠a-Andrade et al., 2012] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471482/" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471482/</a>). The model event is defined by the sum of two exponentials using the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(t) = exp \left (\frac{-t}{\tau_{decay}} \right ) - exp\left (\frac{-t}{\tau_{rise}} \right )\]</span> <font size="2"><span class="math display">\[\textrm{Where}\ t \ \textrm{is time},\ \tau_{decay}\ \textrm{is the decay time constant and}\ \tau_{rise}\ \textrm{is the rise time constant.}\]</span></font></p>
<p>Select the <code>Template</code> tab next to load the interface for this task. Click on the <code>Pop-up Graph</code> button and zoom in on an exemplary mEPSC. Next, click the button decorated with the cursor pointer (highlighted in the figure below) and click on the pop-up graph at two positions; one just before the mEPSC and the other after the mEPSC has decayed. Eventer will try to fit a model mEPSC waveform to the selected data. The time constants will then be in the boxes below the highlighted button and should then be copied into boxes above before selecting the button <code>Apply to all waves</code>. Ensure the sign of your events is correctly assigned as <code>-</code>.</p>

<p>We now need to ensure the that output of the analysis will be what and where we want it to be. Click the <code>Output</code> tab to show the range of options available then click the <code>Output folder</code> button <strong>and name it with your surname</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, click the <code>Wave Format</code> drop-down menu and select <code>HDF5 (Stimfit) binary (.h5)</code> - this is because we will analyse further the detected and aligned mEPSCs using another software (Stimfit) in the next topic.</p>
<p>Next, click the <code>Store all waves</code> button to ensure that the analysis is applied to all 4 waves.</p>
<p>Next, click the drop-down menu (highlighted in the figure below) and change it from <code>Current</code> to <code>Batch</code> - this will tell Eventer to analyse all stored waves.</p>
<p>Having confirmed all these settings the user can hit ‚ÄòRun‚Äô and the light will turn green indicating analysis is in progress.</p>

<h3>Training a machine learning model</h3>
<p>Eventer also includes an option to enable users train a machine learning model against an exemplary set of data. To do this, click the <code>Detection</code> tab, then set the <code>Event Criterion</code> drop-down menu to <code>Machine Learning</code> before ticking the <code>Training Mode</code> tick box. Running the analysis now will open up a window that will ask users to classify event detection as true or false. A pop-up window will appear asking for you to name your model - leave this as your surname. Click the <code>Store</code> button again, followed by the <code>Run</code> button.</p>
<p>After the analysis has completed, a pop-up window titled ‚ÄòClassify events‚Äô will appear. In this window, click the <code>Start</code> button and then the <code>Select all</code> button. To scroll up or down through the detected events, press the <code>K</code> or <code>M</code> keys respectively on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Use you judgment to make a call on whether you think the mEPSC (starting at the time of the vertical <font color="green">green</font> line) should be considered a real event. If you think Eventer falsely detected an event, press the <code>R</code> key to deselect it. When you have visually inspected and classified all of the candidate mEPSCs, click the <code>Complete</code> button to close the <code>Classify events</code> window and train a machine learning model using the Random Forests algorithm. This algorithm builds decision trees using various predefined features of the data to best satisfy your classification. Upon completing the classification and starting the training, you will be presented with a plot showing the out-of-bag classification error which can briefly be described as a measure of the prediction error using bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to subsample data samples used for training. The prediction error should then stabilize well before reaching 128 trees (which is the default number of trees used by the implementation of Random Forests in Eventer).</p>

<h3>Using a machine learning model</h3>
<p>The real beauty of machine learning is that trained models can be used to apply your criteria of selection or classification to a set of new data. Lets give this a go using a model prepared in our lab using a different (but comparable) recording.</p>
<p>Click on the <code>Detection</code> tab - you will notice that the <code>Training mode</code> checkbox is already unchecked and the machine learning model (.mlm) file listed is the one you just created. that will and select load model in the detection tab. The trained model will be stored in the eventer output folder as a .mlm file as shown here. This model is now available for use on a new dataset, distinct from the set it was trained on.</p>
<p>Click the <code>Load model</code> button, navigate to <code>S:\ATiN\Tutorial\Eventer\model</code> in the file dialog and load the file named <code>model.mlm</code>.</p>
<p>To ensure we save the output of this analysis to a different place, click the <code>Output</code> tab to show the range of options available then click the <code>Output folder</code> button <strong>and name it with your surname followed by _mlm </strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, click the <code>Store</code> button followed by the <code>Run</code> button.</p>

<h2>4. Measuring EPSC properties</h2>
<p>We have detected mEPSCs and we have some basic summary data about them from Eventer. Lets now get some detailed data about the amplitude and kinetics of individual events. We will achieve this using the open source software package called Stimfit.</p>
<div id="section-start-the-software-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Start the software</h3>
<p>If the Stimfit software is not already loaded, double click on the Stimfit 0.13 icon visible on the desktop. It looks like this:</p>

<h3>Configure cursor settings</h3>
<p>The mEPSCs are downward deflections of the current, so before we ask Stimfit to make measurements on the mEPSCs, we need to tell Stimfit that we expect peaks to be negative.</p>
<p>First, go to the <code>Edit</code> menu and click <code>Cursor settings...</code>.</p>

<h3>Calculate ensemble mean mEPSC</h3>
<p>Lets now calculate an ensemble mean mEPSC to help us decide on where to position the cursors used for making measurements. Press <code>Ctrl + A</code> key combination to select all of the mEPSCs and then the highlighted button to average the selected traces. This will pop up a new window which you should close by clicking <code>Close</code> in the <code>File</code> menu. You will then see the ensemble mean mEPSC in <font color="blue">blue</font> overlaid onto one of the currently selected mEPSC.</p>

<h3>Set the baseline cursors</h3>
<p>The holding current is seldom exactly zero so we need to subtract the constant offset represented by the baseline preceding the mEPSC.

The start and end of the baseline region is illustrated by <font color="green">green</font> vertical dashed lines. for each mEPSC, the offset will be calculated as the mean of the sample points between these two time points. Use the ensemble mean mEPSC as a guide for where you position these cursors.</p>

<h3>Visualising measurements</h3>
<p>If you now scroll through the mEPSCs using your <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> cursor keys, you will notice that there are additional annotations, like in the figure below.
